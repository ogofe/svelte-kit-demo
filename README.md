# A Simple Ecommerce Svelte Application

This is just a starter template to show how easy it is to get started with svelte and using Svelte-Kit
Overtime, I will revisit this project, and I am currently working on a better UI

## Setting up

Clone the repo

```bash
# grab your local copy
git clone https://github.com/ogofe/svelte-kit-demo.git


# install the dependencies
cd svelte-kit-demo && yarn install
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn run dev
